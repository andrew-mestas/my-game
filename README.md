# my-game
Welcome to the online PokeyMon clone! 
This is a personal project I would like to expand on. Most images and game data are taken from the http://pokeapi.co/ 
Additional resources 

+ downloads.khinsider.com - video game music
+ kiwi.js - game engine 
+ pokemondb.net - images
+ playonloop.com/2015-music-loops - looped background songs

Goals for this project - 

+ Get a world map up and running (working on this)
+ Get the battle system running smoothly (really close on this)
+ Work on level/levelup and exp. system (coming later)
+ Game music and animation (fan music most likely)
+ Get a working pokedex that queries the pokeapi to load data
+ Open to any suggestions/ requests

I would like to expand on the pkmn game play to create all the things I wish I had in my old red version.
